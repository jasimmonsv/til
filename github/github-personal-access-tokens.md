# Where to find Github personall access tokens
Setting up this TIL project from @simonw, I needed to find where to create personal access tokens,
and it took way longer then it should have. Was trying to add specific access to the needed repo
but the Github action was not built for that apperently. Possible feature to add later.

1. User profile -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens
2. Still need to review what all the permissons do
